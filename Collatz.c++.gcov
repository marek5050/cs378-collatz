        -:   24: * Consider the following algorithm:
        -:   25: * 1. input n
        -:   26: * 2. print n
        -:   27: * 3. if n = 1 then STOP
        -:   28: *         4. if n is odd then n = 3n + 1
        -:   29: * 
        -:   30: *          5. else n = n / 2
        -:   31: * 6. GOTO 2
        -:   32: * Given the input 22, the following sequence of numbers will be printed 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
        -:   33: * 
        -:   34: * It is conjectured that the algorithm above will terminate (when a 1 is printed) for any integral input value. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, it is unknown whether this conjecture is true. It has been verified, however, for all integers n such that 0 < n < 1,000,000 (and, in fact, for many more numbers than this.)
        -:   35: * 
        -:   36: * Given an input n, it is possible to determine the number of numbers printed (including the 1). For a given n this is called the cycle-length of n. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16.
        -:   37: * 
        -:   38: * For any two numbers i and j you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers between i and j.
